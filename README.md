I'll help you create a clear, informative README that showcases your analysis. Here's a suggested structure:

# LEGO Price Analysis

Analysis of 1,167 LEGO set prices to find value patterns across age ranges, sizes, and price brackets.

## Overview
This project analyzes LEGO set pricing data to understand what drives value and identify patterns in LEGO's pricing strategy. Using data from over 1,000 current LEGO sets, I discovered significant patterns in how age ranges affect pricing, identified sweet spots for value, and explored the relationship between set size and cost.

## Key Findings
- Age range explains 84.2% of price variation in LEGO sets
- Sets for young children (1½+) have the highest price per piece ($2.02)
- Best value appears in the 12+ age range ($0.080 per piece)
- Mid-sized sets (300-800 pieces) consistently offer the best value
- Most sets cluster in the $20-50 range (360 sets)

## Technical Details
- Data collected from LEGO's official website using Python
- Analysis performed in R using tidyverse, ggplot2, and stats packages
- Dataset includes 1,167 sets with 10+ pieces
- Statistical analysis includes Shapiro-Wilk test for distribution normality
